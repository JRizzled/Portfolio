As a Computer Science Major, I have a vested interest in AI as it becomes more popular and more relevent in our day to day 
lives. As a Philosophy Minor, I have an interest in not only the metaphysical aspects of AI, but also the ethical side of it.
The purpose of this Literature review is to look at how AI companies, such as Meta, Google, OpenAI and others, often if not 
always fail to document and record the data they use to train their models on. Much of this data is personal and essentially 
anything you have published on social media or Youtube has likely been used in one of these models. The audience for this 
blurb is mainly for people who have at least a high school education and prefereably some college and basic understanding of computers
However, it is also for artists, writers, and other content creaters who have concerns about copyright infringement and their 
own art and intelectual creative labor being usurped for Big Tech to use for their own benefit without any compensation. 

This file was created using a combination of my own web surfing, as well as, somewhat ironically, 
assistance from AI and it's Deepsearch function. I compiled my data into several notes, and 
then consolidated them into the final tables. The tables break down the problems and aspects of 
several AI models of all different forms.
