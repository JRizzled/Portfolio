This study examines the prevalence of keywords such as “data tracking”, “data provenance”, “data integrity”, and “copyright protection” within the abstracts of every Computer Science research paper in arXiv’s 2.5+ million‑paper corpus. Using Kaggle‑sourced metadata and a custom Python script, we tracked occurrences of these keywords by publication year and compared them with total paper counts. The resulting visualization highlights an industry‑wide deficit of attention to data tracking and protection—an issue that must be addressed.
