The following chart breaks down the trends in Computer Science research by subcategory. This 
chart took stats from the STEM research hub website arXiv. I extracted the data 
from the Statistics part of the website https://arxiv.org/stats/main, converted it into a 
CSV, parsed it, and then used Chart.js top plot the number of submissions by subcategory of 
the main category, Computer Science.

If you click on the button Show Top 5 Lines, and then click on Show Legend, you will see the following lines:
    
    1. "cs.CV – Computer Vision & Pattern Rec.",
    2. "cs.LG – Machine Learning",
    3. "cs.AI – Artificial Intelligence",
    4. "cs.CY – Computers & Society",
    5. "cs.CR – Cryptography & Security"

You will see that the top 3 lines, which are all AI related, have grown in terms
of total number of publications, where is the last 2, which related more to the 
ethics and humanity aspect of technology, have largely stagnated. 

This, in my opinion, further highlights the dire need for more research 
into these more interdisciplinary fields of AI and Philosophy, or more specifically, 
AI and Ethics.
